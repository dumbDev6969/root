## MVP Integration Points

Each MVP should consider these integration points:
1. Data Flow Integration
2. User Interface Integration
3. Service Integration
4. Event Integration

## Evolution Strategy

The ecosystem will evolve through:
1. Individual MVP Development
2. Component Integration
3. System Expansion
4. Service Enhancement
