Here's a summary of the UI/UX laws mentioned in the article, along with examples from AJIO's UX analysis:

1. **Consistency**: Consistency in design elements, such as typography, color schemes, and layout, helps to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
	* Example: AJIO maintains consistency in its navigation and layout, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for.
2. **Fitts' Law**: The time it takes to move to a target is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target.
	* Example: AJIO's use of large icons and text labels ensures that the target area is large enough to select, making it easier for users to navigate.
3. **Hick's Law**: The time it takes to make a decision is a function of the number of options available.
	* Example: AJIO's simple and organized design makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for, reducing the time it takes to make a decision.
4. **Law of Proximity**: Elements that are related should be grouped together.
	* Example: AJIO groups related products together, making it easy for users to find similar items.
5. **Law of Similarity**: Elements that are similar should be grouped together.
	* Example: AJIO uses similar design elements, such as typography and color schemes, to create a cohesive look and feel.
6. **Law of Closure**: The human brain tends to complete incomplete shapes and forms.
	* Example: AJIO's use of simple shapes and forms makes it easy for users to understand the design and navigate the site.
7. **Law of Continuity**: The human brain tends to follow the direction of lines and curves.
	* Example: AJIO's use of clean lines and curves makes it easy for users to follow the design and navigate the site.
8. **Law of Figure-Ground**: The human brain tends to separate elements into figure (foreground) and ground (background).
	* Example: AJIO's use of contrasting colors and typography makes it easy for users to distinguish between different elements on the site.
9. **Law of Pragnanz**: The human brain tends to simplify complex shapes and forms.
	* Example: AJIO's use of simple shapes and forms makes it easy for users to understand the design and navigate the site.
10. **Law of Common Region**: Elements that are in the same region are perceived as related.
	* Example: AJIO groups related products together, making it easy for users to find similar items.
11. **Law of Alignment**: Elements should be aligned to create a clear and organized design.
	* Example: AJIO's use of grid-based design makes it easy for users to navigate the site and find what they're looking for.
12. **Law of Repetition**: Consistent design elements, such as typography and color schemes, should be repeated throughout the design.
	* Example: AJIO's consistent use of typography and color schemes creates a cohesive look and feel throughout the site.
